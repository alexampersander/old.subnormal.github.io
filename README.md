Portfolio
===================

This is just my test site. Everything goes here. I have no idea what I intend to do, but I need a portfolio eventually. Also, my html is incredibly messy and I apologize to anyone looking at it for whatever reason you might be looking at it. NSA?

## Todo:
* Add all of my "skills"
* Expand out from just the index page
* Add some examples of my work
* Incorporate Flat UI / Flatstrap / Square UI
* Incorporate Parse
* Replace animation with something I _actually created_

## Goals:
* Have fun with this project!
* Stare in awe at the vibrant colors of Flat UI
* Be productive this summer
* Drive, I guess
